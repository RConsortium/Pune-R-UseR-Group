# **Introduction to Shiny: Build Interactive Web Apps with R**

## **What is R Shiny?**

Shiny is an R package that allows you to build interactive web applications without needing to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or business analyst, Shiny helps transform static reports into dynamic, web-based applications.

With just a few lines of R code, you can create dashboards, visualize live data, and interact with datasets in real time.

## **Why Use Shiny?**

Here’s why Shiny is a game-changer for R programmers:\
✅ **Easy to Get Started** – No need for web development skills, if you know coding in R that is enough to get started in Shiny. \
✅ **Interactivity** – Users can manipulate data and see updates instantly\
✅ **Data Visualization** – Generate interactive plots and tables effortlessly\
✅ **Deploy Anywhere** – Publish apps online with platforms like ShinyApps.io which is easy to share with others.

## **Shiny App Structure**

Shiny apps are structured in three main ways:\
1️⃣ **Single File (app.R)** – Everything (UI + server) is written in a single file.\
2️⃣ **Separate Files (ui.R & server.R)** – UI and backend logic are split into different files.\
3️⃣ **Shiny Frameworks (Golem, Rhino)** – For advanced Shiny applications with modular structures.

## **Reactivity: The Power of Shiny**

Shiny’s **reactivity** makes apps dynamic. It works by updating outputs whenever inputs change.

Reactivity in Shiny can be seen in different forms : \
🔹 **Reactive Inputs** – User-provided values (e.g., text boxes, dropdowns)\
🔹 **Reactive Expressions** – Automatically recalculates when inputs change\
🔹 **Reactive Outputs** – Dynamically updates tables, plots, and text based on inputs\
🔹 **Observers** – Executes actions (e.g., saving a file) without returning a value

## **Shiny in Action**

Here are some real-world Shiny apps:\
🔹 **Basic Apps** – [Example 1](https://shahronak.shinyapps.io/my_shiny_app/)\
🔹 **Advanced Dashboards** – [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\
🔹 **Creative Uses** – [TidyTuesday App](https://nrennie.rbind.io/tidytuesday-shiny-app/)

## **Deploying Your Shiny App**

Once your app is ready, you can publish it on:\
📌 **ShinyApps.io** – A free hosting platform (up to 5 apps, 25 active hours)\
📌 **RStudio Connect** – Enterprise-level hosting for Shiny apps

## **Conclusion**

Shiny is a powerful tool for turning R scripts into interactive web applications. Whether you're analyzing data, building dashboards, or sharing insights, Shiny makes it simple and accessible.
